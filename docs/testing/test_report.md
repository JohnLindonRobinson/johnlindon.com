## Common Issues
1. Missing Dependencies:
   - @/components/ui/Button
   - @/lib/prisma
   - next-themes

2. File Resolution Issues:
   - Several imports using @ alias not resolving correctly
   - Relative imports not finding files

3. Testing Framework Issues:
   - Some Jest references still present in tests
   - Missing test environment configurations

4. Inconsistent mocking of window.matchMedia

5. Animation timing in tests

6. Iframe load event simulation

## Coverage Goals
- Unit Tests: 80% coverage target
- Integration Tests: Key user flows covered
- End-to-End Tests: Critical paths tested

## Next Steps
1. Fix Import Resolution:
   - Configure path aliases correctly in Vitest config
   - Update import statements to use correct paths

2. Resolve Dependencies:
   - Install missing npm packages
