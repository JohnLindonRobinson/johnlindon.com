## Test Results Summary
- Total Test Files: 22
- Passing Files: 1
- Failing Files: 21
- Total Tests: 30
- Passing Tests: 20
- Failing Tests: 10

## Common Issues
1. Missing Dependencies:
   - @/components/ui/Button
   - @/lib/prisma
   - @/hooks/useError
   - @/lib/security/encryption
   - next-themes

2. File Resolution Issues:
   - Several imports using @ alias not resolving correctly
   - Relative imports not finding files (e.g., "./Spinner")

3. Testing Framework Issues:
   - Jest references in tests but Vitest is being used
   - Missing test environment configurations

## Coverage Goals
- Unit Tests: 80% coverage target
- Integration Tests: Key user flows covered
- End-to-End Tests: Critical paths tested

## Next Steps
1. Fix Import Resolution:
   - Configure path aliases correctly in Vitest config
   - Update import statements to use correct paths

2. Resolve Dependencies:
   - Install missing npm packages
   - Create missing component files
   - Set up proper test environment

3. Framework Migration:
   - Update tests to use Vitest instead of Jest
   - Add proper mocking utilities

4. Component Fixes:
   - Update Card component to properly handle custom classes
   - Fix Button component loading state
   - Add proper ARIA roles for accessibility

## Notes
- Test environment needs proper setup for Next.js components
- Security tests require environment variables
- Some integration tests need mocking of external services

## Recent Changes
- Added comprehensive security testing suite
- Implemented new UI component tests
- Added integration tests for user journeys
